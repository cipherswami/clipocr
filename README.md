# ClipOCR :: CIPH3R

## Introduction

`ClipOCR` is a python script to extract the text from clipboard images and then automatically copy back the recognized text to clipboard.

## Motive

- Many users often need to extract text from images quickly without manually typing or scanning the text. `ClipOCR` solves this problem by providing an automated way to capture text from clipboard images.
  
## Pre Installation:

- Clone the repository using the following command (or) download the latest ZIP file from [here](https://codeload.github.com/cipherswami/clipocr/zip/refs/heads/main), and extract it:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cipherswami/clipocr.git
    ```

- Install Tesseract OCR from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), and ensure it is added to your system PATH.

  - Now go to the src folder containing `clipocr.py` and edit the script to configure the path for Tesseract OCR if needed:

    ```python
    # Set your custom Tesseract OCR's path if changed
    pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\your\path\to\tesseract.exe'
    ```

- Ensure **Python 3** is installed. If not download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install, while installing ensure you check the box to **Add Python to PATH** during installation.
